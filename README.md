Below is a complete, extremely detailed README.md file for your ensemble (Mixture-of-Experts) project. Copy and paste the following content into a file called README.md in the root of your repository.

# Ensemble MoE Project

Welcome to the **Ensemble MoE Project**! This repository contains a full end-to-end example of how to build an ensemble (or mixture-of-experts) system using open-source transformer models from Hugging Face. We will show you step by step—from setting up your environment to training, inference, and deployment—even if you are new to these concepts. Think of this as a guide written in "cave-man style" to make every step clear.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to combine multiple transformer models (each considered an "expert") into a single system that we call a “big brain.” The ensemble is built by using a learnable gating network to weight the outputs of each expert model based on the input. In this project:

- **Experts:** We use several pretrained models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet) that have been fine-tuned for text classification.
- **Gating Network:** A small neural network that decides which model’s prediction to trust more for each input.
- **Applications:** Although our example task is text classification (using the SST-2 dataset), the same ideas can be applied to more complex tasks such as cancer imaging analysis or drug simulation.
- **Open Source:** All code is provided and designed to be as transparent and customizable as possible, so even if you’re new to this, you can learn by example.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.9 or later:** Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git:** Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads/).
- A basic familiarity with the command line (terminal) is helpful.

For Windows users, it is recommended to use Git Bash or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

---

## Environment Setup

### Step 1: Create a Project Directory

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
mkdir ensemble_project
cd ensemble_project
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Python Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
	•	On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

•	On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```


Your terminal prompt should now start with (venv).

### Step 3: Upgrade pip

Inside your virtual environment, upgrade pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

## Installing Dependencies

Create a file named requirements.txt in the root directory with the following content:

```bash
torch
transformers
datasets
accelerate
deepspeed
trl
vllm
tensorboard
flask
```
Then, install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all necessary libraries, including PyTorch and Hugging Face tools.

## Training the Ensemble Model

The training code is located in src/train.py. Here’s a summary of what happens in the training process:
	
### 1.	Load Dataset:

We use the SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) dataset from the GLUE benchmark as an example.
	
### 2.	Preprocess Data:

The raw text is tokenized using a Hugging Face tokenizer (from the first expert model) and converted into PyTorch tensors.
	
### 3.	DataLoader:

We use DataLoader to create batches for training.

### 4.	Model Initialization:

The ensemble model is initialized using the expert model names provided.

### 5.	Optimizer and Scheduler:

AdamW optimizer is set up with a linear scheduler to manage the learning rate.

### 6.	Training Loop:

The loop iterates over epochs and batches, performing the forward pass, computing cross-entropy loss, backpropagating errors, and updating model parameters. Losses are logged with TensorBoard, and checkpoints are saved periodically.

To run the training script, execute:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

You can monitor training progress using TensorBoard:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=runs
```

Then, open the provided URL in your web browser.

## Running Inference

The inference script is located in src/inference.py. This script shows you how to:

### 1.	Load a Saved Checkpoint:

It loads model parameters from a checkpoint file (for example, checkpoints/checkpoint-step-50.pt).

### 2.	Perform a Forward Pass:

New input texts are processed by the ensemble model, and predictions are generated.

### 3.	Output Predictions:

The script prints the predicted class labels.

To test inference, run:

```bash
python src/inference.py
```

---

## Deploying the Model

### Option 1: Serve via Flask Web API

The Flask API is provided in src/app.py. This web server accepts POST requests with text inputs and returns predictions.

To run the API locally, execute:

```bash
python src/app.py
```

Then, test the endpoint (for example, using curl):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"texts": ["I love this product!", "I hate this service."]}'
```

### Option 2: Deploy on Cloud Platforms

You can deploy your model using Hugging Face Inference Endpoints or containerize your application with Docker. See the deployment instructions in the repository’s documentation or in this README under the “Deploying on Cloud Platforms” section below.

Deploying on Hugging Face Inference Endpoints
	1.	**Prepare your model:** Save your model checkpoint and push your code to a Hugging Face model repository.
	2.	**Configure an Inference Script:** Create a script (or modify inference.py) to meet Hugging Face’s Inference Endpoint requirements.
	3.	**Deploy the Endpoint:** Follow Hugging Face’s step-by-step deployment guide via the web UI.

### Deploying with Docker (Optional)

A sample Dockerfile is provided below:

```bash
# Use an official Python image.
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory.
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements and install them.
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the repository files.
COPY . .

# Expose port 5000.
EXPOSE 5000

# Set the entry point to run the Flask app.
CMD ["python", "src/app.py"]
```

Build and run your container:

```bash
docker build -t ensemble-moE-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 ensemble-moE-app
```
